        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Grenouille is born in a market in Paris in July of 1738 to a young fishmonger. Due to the heat and the stench, Grenouilleâ€™s mother passes out immediately after his birth, drawing a crowd. When she comes to she abandons her baby, but a crowd discovers the baby and his mother is arrested, tried, and beheaded. Grenouille goes through a series of wet nurses, all of whom accuse him of being especially greedy for milk. His final wet nurse is Jeanne Bussie. Several weeks after she takes custody of him, she returns him to Father Terrier at the cloister of Saint Merri, stating that Grenouille is possessed by the devil because he doesn't have a smell. Father Terrier attempts to pay Jeanne Bussie more money to keep the baby but eventually gives in. When the sleeping Grenouille wakes and sniffs the air in a menacing way, Father Terrier is terrified and takes Grenouille straight to Madame Gaillard, who runs a home for orphans.

            Madame Gaillard was hit across the face with a poker as a child and as such, has no sense of smell and doesn't experience emotions. She doesn't realize that Grenouille doesn't smell and doesn't expect him to express emotion, which suits Grenouille well. The other children attempt to murder him but eventually give up. As he grows, Grenouille catalogues every scent he comes across. He finds language inadequate to express his olfactory world, and never fully grasps concepts such as morality or goodness. At age eight, the cloister stops paying for Grenouille's keep, and Madame Gaillard sells him to a tanner named Grimal.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 30px; font-size:30px;">Richis and Laure leave early that morning. Grenouille, meanwhile, had been preparing to take Laure's scent that night. But when he steps outside, he finds he cannot smell her and panics. Druot in passing mentions that Richis and Laure left for Grenoble.</p>
